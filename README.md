Topic: Emergency Button

Professor: Charles Hoot Group 
Member: Enid Maharjan

Uses: I build this application to help people in danger. Just by pressing the emergency button, users current location can be send to Family members at regular interval via SMS. The only requirement is that the phone number should be active.

Instruction on running the App.
Running this app is fairly simple. Install the app in the android phone, or run it through android studio. Press emergency to send messages. Press floating action button to add contacts and add contacts accordingly. Press chat icon to edit emergency messages. View location from the location icon. Drag the contacts bar or press it to view contacts. Emergency won’t send messages without adding contacts, so add it beforehand.

Layouts and their Description:
User Registration: User can input the number and the name of just can have a contact information saved via contact list. Direct Login and details will be saved.

Emergency Button: Gets activated by pressing it. After which the app sends Emergency SMS to members and provides regular intervals SMS of current location.

Edit Member Details: User can edit member details like add or delete contacts

Risk Components: I am working with multiple APIs. Mostly consisting of Google Login Authorization and Google Map API. Likewise, I might use some more API which I am current doing research on. 

Require functionality: 
1) Map, Database for user login and storing the user information, 
2) Descriptions of data to be entered into the system 
3) Descriptions of operations performed by each screen 
4) Security requirements 
• Admin need to login with their valid login credentials in order to access the system 
• View User: All the registered user’s details can be viewed by admin. 

Emergency Button app is fully functional at this point and can be installed in Android devices with API 21 and Above. We will integrate app in future.
